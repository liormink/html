<h2>mma</h2>

i began watching at the recomeendation of my older brother in 2008 ,and i never looked back ever since
for me it was a natural continuation ,as i spent my youth watching wwe ,sprts entertainment.
the biggest promotion now (and for the near future) is the ufc.


the rules are almost everything goes ,except for eye gauging ,biting ,low blows and punches to the back
of the head.
<br>
it called mma becuase its mix stand up fighting :karate ,boxing ,takewando and also submission on the 
ground.
so the fighters needs to be highly skilled on many dicpilens.
<br>
the ufc has 8 weight championship :
<ol>
flyweight - 125 pound ,
bantamweight - 135 pound ,
featerweight - 145 pound ,
lightweight - 155 pound ,
walterweight - 170 pound ,
middleweight - 185 pound ,
lightheavyweight - 205 pound ,
heawvyweight - 225 pound
</ol>

<h3>training</h3>

i train mostly at home and at short periods at the gym (never more than a year) . i mostly train with weight lifting.
<br>
i train at home for 10-15 minutes top with exercises that focus on arms and shoulders.

<h4>podcasting</h4>

i love to listen to podcasts in english for 2 reasons:
<ol>
<li> it has the most variety of topics in the world</li>
<li>it's improve your english while you listen to it</li>
</ol>

i listen to joe rogan who has more than thousand podcasts . he does about 4-5 podcasts a week.
ofcurse i dont hear all his podcats ,only the ones who seem interesting.
<br>
also i liten to podcats of sports (wrestling and mma) and tv reviews.

<h4>reading</h4>

as with podcasts i have books in hebrew and english ,both on paper and digital books with apps like
kindel and <a href=" https://www.e-vrit.co.il/" target=" blank">evrit</a>. 
<br>
i love to read about science ,philosophy ,biography ,religion ,adventure and basically anything that seems interesting to me.
